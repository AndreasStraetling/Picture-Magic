# Picture-Magic

Update:
Why is the upload not working yet? Because the server-side-handler is not called correctly. I guess the handler will work, as soon as it's called. I'm trying to fix this.

But because I want you to still see the picture(s) moving around, I just hardcoded a picture into the site so you can actually click the "magical" button.

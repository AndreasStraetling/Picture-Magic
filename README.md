# Picture-Magic

Select a file, upload it, and click the magical button to see what happens.

Why is the upload not working yet? Because python's / flask's "file.save()" isn't (yet) used correctly... I'm trying to fix this.
Anyway, I placed pictures into the site ("hard-coded") so you can actually click the "magical" button and see what's happening.

Compatibility:
Fixed a "for-of"-loop in Javascript which prevented the Magic happening.
This site should now work even in older browsers.

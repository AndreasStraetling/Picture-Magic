# Picture-Magic

Because of some reason I'm not fully aware of (yet), the upload of an image (or multiple images) doesn't work - despite the
website telling you the file is being uploaded to 100%.
I'm trying to fix this. Please let me know if you have any ideas what the reason may be. Thanks :)

But because I want you to still see the picture(s) moving around, I just hardcoded a picture into the site so you can actually click the "magical" button.
